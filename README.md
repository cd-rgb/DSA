# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains important DSA topics with focused solutions and practice problems.  
It is organized into folders based on topic types for easier navigation and learning.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

- **2Darray**  
  Problems and solutions related to 2D Arrays, matrices, and grids.

- **array**  
  Fundamental array-based problems — searching, manipulation, optimization, etc.

- **linkedlist**  
  Linked list operations including insertion, deletion, reversal, cycle detection, etc.

- **sorting**  
  Classic and advanced sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

- **stack**  
  Stack data structure problems, including parentheses matching, expression evaluation, etc.

- **string**  
  String manipulation problems, pattern matching, anagrams, palindromes, etc.
